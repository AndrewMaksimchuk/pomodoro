# :tomato: Pomodoro

The Pomodoro method is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.  
This method uses a timer to break down the work into 25-minute intervals  
called "pomodori" (Italian word meaning "tomatoes") and separated by short breaks.  

This simple program locks the screen every 25 minutes and takes a break of 5 minutes,  
which will give you the opportunity to take a break and freshen up a bit.  

Built on :electron: [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).  

To run the program you need:
1. clone the repository, go to the folder named ```pomodoro```
2. then open a terminal in it (command line)
3. in the terminal enter the command ```npm i```
4. now you can run the program through the terminal with the command ```npm run start```  

No settings, just run and go :footprints:
